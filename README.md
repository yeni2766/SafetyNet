# Agile Methodologies

For this project, I utilized agile methodologies to effectively manage the development process. I created a Gantt chart to outline tasks and set realistic deadlines, which helped me to stay on track and ensure that I was making progress towards my goals. I also held regular meetings with my supervisor to discuss progress and make any necessary adjustments to the project plan. By utilizing these methodologies, I was able to successfully complete the project within the given timeframe while maintaining a high standard of quality.


# Improvements
There are several areas for improvement in this project. One is the implementation of more advanced features, such as machine learning algorithms, to detect and prevent cyberbullying. Another is to conduct user testing to get feedback on the user experience and implement any necessary changes to improve it. Finally, it would be beneficial to expand the platform to support more social media networks, such as Twitter and Instagram, to provide a more comprehensive solution to cyberbullying.

In conclusion, this project allowed me to apply all the knowledge and skills I gained during my 3 years in university to create a solution that addresses a significant social issue. The project was challenging, but it helped me to develop my programming, project management, and problem-solving skills. I am proud of what I accomplished and the impact it can have on tackling cyberbullying.
